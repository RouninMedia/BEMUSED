**N.B.** The slightly different _modifier_ syntax in **Bemuse** originally arose from a misunderstanding of how **BEM** modifiers were supposed to work and the mistaken interpretation that they required _extensive duplication_ in the CSS - whereas, in fact, they require _minimal duplication_ in the HTML. That misunderstanding has long since been cleared up, but, to some front-end developers at least, **Bemuse** modifiers will continue to feel preferable.
